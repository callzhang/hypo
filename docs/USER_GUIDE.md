---

### macOS Installation

#### Option 1: Direct Download (Recommended)

1. **Download Application**
   ```bash
   # Download from releases page
   curl -L https://github.com/callzhang/hypo/releases/latest/download/Hypo-1.0.2.zip -o Hypo-1.0.2.zip
   unzip Hypo-1.0.2.zip
   ```

2. **Remove Quarantine Attribute** (Required for downloaded apps)
   ```bash
   # macOS adds quarantine attribute when downloading from internet
   # This causes "app is damaged" error - remove it:
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine HypoApp.app
   ```

3. **Install to Applications**
   ```bash
   # Move to Applications folder
   sudo mv HypoApp.app /Applications/
   
   # Make executable (if needed)
   chmod +x /Applications/HypoApp.app/Contents/MacOS/HypoMenuBar
   ```

4. **First Launch & Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Launch from command line first time
   open /Applications/HypoApp.app
   ```
   
   **Grant Required Permissions**:
   - **Accessibility**: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → Add Hypo
   - **Network**: Allow when prompted
   - **Notifications**: System Settings → Notifications → Hypo → Allow

5. **Verify Installation**
   - Hypo icon appears in menu bar
   - Click icon → "Settings" → Check version number
   - Status should show "Ready to pair"

#### Option 2: Build from Source

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install Xcode and command line tools
   xcode-select --install
   
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/callzhang/hypo.git
   cd hypo
   ```

2. **Build Application Using Build Script (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Build macOS app (debug, default)
   ./scripts/build-macos.sh
   
   # Build release version
   ./scripts/build-macos.sh release
   
   # Clean build (removes build cache)
   ./scripts/build-macos.sh clean
   ```
   
   The script will:
   - Build the app using Swift Package Manager
   - Create `HypoApp.app` bundle (debug) or `HypoApp-release.app` bundle (release)
   - Sign the app for local development

3. **Build Application Using Xcode**
   ```bash
   cd macos
   
   # Open in Xcode
   open HypoApp.xcworkspace
   
   # Or build from command line
   xcodebuild -workspace HypoApp.xcworkspace \
              -scheme HypoApp \
              -configuration Release \
              -derivedDataPath build/
   ```

4. **Install Built App**
   ```bash
   # From build script output
   # Debug app is built at: macos/HypoApp.app
   # Release app is built at: macos/HypoApp-release.app
   
   # Or from Xcode build
   cp -r build/Build/Products/Release/HypoApp.app /Applications/
   ```

#### Auto-Start Setup (Optional)

```bash
# Create launch agent for auto-start
cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.hypo.agent.plist << 'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.hypo.agent</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/Applications/HypoApp.app/Contents/MacOS/HypoMenuBar</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

# Load the launch agent
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.hypo.agent.plist
```

---

### Windows Installation

There is no installer and no signing certificate, so Windows will warn about an
unrecognised application the first time. That is expected for an unsigned zip.

1. **Download and unzip**

   Take `Hypo-<version>-windows-x64.zip` (or `-arm64.zip` on an ARM machine)
   from the [releases page](https://github.com/callzhang/hypo/releases) and
   unzip it anywhere you like — `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Hypo` is a reasonable
   home. Unzip it before running: Windows runs an executable from inside a zip
   in a temporary folder that disappears.

2. **Run `Hypo.exe`**

   SmartScreen shows "Windows protected your PC". Choose **More info → Run
   anyway**. It appears once, not every launch.

3. **Allow it through the firewall**

   Windows asks on first launch. **Private networks** is the box that matters —
   that is how LAN sync finds other devices. Declining it does not break Hypo;
   it falls back to the relay, which is slower.

4. **Start it with Windows** (optional)

   Press <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, run `shell:startup`, and put a shortcut to
   `Hypo.exe` in the folder that opens.

**Data lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hypo`** — history database, settings, device
identity, and files received from peers. To uninstall: quit from the tray icon,
delete the folder you unzipped, and delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hypo`.

### Android Installation

#### Option 1: APK Installation (Current Method)

1. **Download APK**
   ```bash
   # Download latest APK
   curl -L https://github.com/callzhang/hypo/releases/latest/download/Hypo.1.0.2.apk \
        -o Hypo.1.0.2.apk
   ```

2. **Enable Unknown Sources**
   - Android 8+: Settings → Apps & notifications → Special app access → Install unknown apps
   - Select your browser/file manager → Allow from this source

3. **Install Application**
   ```bash
   # Via ADB (if enabled)
   adb install Hypo.1.0.2.apk
   
   # Or manually: Open file manager → Navigate to APK → Tap to install
   ```

4. **Grant Permissions**
   - **Required Immediately**: Storage, Network
   - **Required for Sync**: Clipboard access (granted when app is in foreground on Android 10+)
   - **Optional but Recommended**: SMS (for SMS auto-sync feature)
   - **Android 13+**: Notification permission (for foreground service)
   - **Critical**: Disable battery optimization for reliable sync
   
   **Note**: On Android 10+, clipboard access is only available when the app is in the foreground. The notification ("Click to sync") allows quick access to sync clipboard content.

5. **Battery Optimization (Critical)**
   ```
   Settings → Battery → Battery Optimization → Hypo → Don't optimize
   ```
   
   **Manufacturer-Specific Settings**:
   
   **Samsung**:
   ```
   Settings → Device care → Battery → App power management
   → Apps that won't be put to sleep → Add Hypo
   ```
   
   **Xiaomi (MIUI/HyperOS)**:
   ```
   Settings → Apps → Manage apps → Hypo → Battery saver → No restrictions
   Settings → Apps → Manage apps → Hypo → Autostart → Enable
   ```
   
   **Note**: Hypo automatically detects MIUI/HyperOS devices and applies workarounds for multicast throttling. The app will show device-specific instructions in Settings when detected.
   
   **OnePlus/OxygenOS**:
   ```
   Settings → Battery → Battery optimization → Hypo → Don't optimize
   Settings → Apps → Hypo → Advanced → Battery → Background activity → Allow
   ```
   
   **Huawei**:
   ```
   Settings → Apps → Hypo → Battery → App launch → Manage manually
   → Enable all three toggles (Auto-launch, Secondary launch, Run in background)
   ```

#### Option 2: Google Play Store (Coming Soon)

```
Google Play Store → Search "Hypo Clipboard" → Install
```

#### Option 3: Build from Source

1. **Setup Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install OpenJDK 17
   brew install openjdk@17
   
   # Setup Android SDK (if not using Android Studio)
   ./scripts/setup-android-sdk.sh
   
   # Clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/callzhang/hypo.git
   cd hypo
   ```

2. **Build APK Using Build Script (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Build debug APK (default, for development/testing)
   ./scripts/build-android.sh
   
   # Build release APK (optimized, ~15-20MB)
   ./scripts/build-android.sh release
   
   # Build both debug and release APKs
   ./scripts/build-android.sh both
   
   # Clean build (removes build cache)
   ./scripts/build-android.sh clean
   ```
   
   **Build Output**:
   - Debug APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` (~47MB)
   - Release APK: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk` (~15-20MB)

3. **Build APK Using Gradle Directly**
   ```bash
   cd android
   
   # Set Android SDK path (if not set)
   export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/path/to/android-sdk
   export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java-17
   
   # Build debug APK
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   
   # Build release APK (optimized with R8/ProGuard)
   ./gradlew assembleRelease
   ```

4. **Install Built APK**
   ```bash
   # Install debug APK via ADB (auto-installs if device connected, default)
   ./scripts/build-android.sh
   
   # Or manually install
   adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
   adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
   ```

**Build Optimizations**:
- Release builds are optimized with R8/ProGuard minification
- Only arm64-v8a ABI included in release (saves ~15MB)
- Unused dependencies removed (ML Kit, Camera libraries)
- Resource shrinking enabled

---

## 📱 Usage

### macOS Usage

**Menu Bar Controls**:
- **Left Click**: Open clipboard history
- **Right Click**: Access settings and pairing
- **⌘+Space**: Quick search (when history open)
- **Escape**: Close history window

**History Window**:
- **Search Bar**: Type to filter items
- **Content Preview**: See full text/image preview
- **Device Badge**: Shows which device item came from
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag items to other apps to paste
- **Double Click**: Copy item back to clipboard

**Keyboard Shortcuts**:
- `⌘F`: Focus search bar
- `⌘R`: Refresh history
- `⌘,`: Open settings
- `⌘Q`: Quit application
- `↑/↓`: Navigate history items
- `Enter`: Copy selected item

### Windows Usage

Hypo is a notification-area icon, not a window. The icon itself is the status:
it says whether sync is connected, over the LAN or the relay, and whether it is
paused — paused and disconnected look different on purpose.

**Global Shortcut**:
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>: Open clipboard history from anywhere

  <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> belongs to the Windows clipboard history and
  cannot be taken. If another application already holds Alt+V, Hypo says so in a
  notification instead of failing quietly, and you can change the combination
  with a `"Hotkey": "Ctrl+Alt+H"` line in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hypo\settings.json`.

**Tray Icon**:
- **Clipboard history…**: Search, and double-click an entry to put it back on
  the clipboard. Focus returns to whatever you were typing in, so the next
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> lands where you expect
- **Pair a device…**: Devices on this network, or a six-digit code for one that
  is not
- **Pause syncing**: Stops sending and receiving without quitting
- **Two sharing switches**: See below
- **Quit**

**Windows Clipboard Sharing** — both switches are **off by default**:

Windows shares clipboard content in two directions that have nothing to do with
Hypo: the local <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> history, and the cloud clipboard
that roams to your Microsoft account and every machine signed into it. Hypo opts
out of both, because it carries whatever was copied on another device, and a
password from a phone's password manager silently roaming to a Microsoft account
is worse than the convenience is good. Turn either on if you want it; turning it
off afterwards does not un-upload anything already sent.

**Received Files**:
- A file from a peer is written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Hypo\received` and its path
  put on the clipboard, so pasting into Explorer works
- Existing files are never overwritten — a peer resending `report.pdf` gets a
  timestamped name

### Android Usage

**Main Screen**:
- **History List**: Scrollable list of clipboard items
- **Search**: Tap search icon to find items

4. Check System Integrity Protection not blocking
5. Try running from Applications folder

**Note**: macOS requires Accessibility permission for clipboard access. Android does not use Accessibility service (it doesn't provide background clipboard access on Android 10+).

### Error Messages

#### "Pairing Failed - Code Expired"
- **Cause**: Pairing code older than 60 seconds
- **Solution**: Generate new pairing code and try again

#### "Connection Timeout"
- **Cause**: Network connectivity issue
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and try cloud sync

#### "Encryption Key Mismatch"
- **Cause**: Devices have different encryption keys
- **Solution**: Re-pair devices to generate new shared keys

#### "Storage Full"
- **Cause**: Clipboard history storage limit reached
- **Solution**: Clear old history items or increase storage limit

### Performance Optimization

#### For Better LAN Performance:
- Use 5GHz Wi-Fi when possible
- Keep devices close to router
- Minimize network traffic during sync
- Use ethernet connection for router

#### For Better Battery Life (Android):
- Reduce history retention period
- Disable sync during battery saver mode
- Use "Adaptive" sync frequency
- Close app when not needed

#### For Better Memory Usage:
- Clear history regularly
- Reduce image quality setting
- Limit file sync to smaller sizes
- Restart apps periodically

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my clipboard data secure?**  
A: Yes. All data is encrypted end-to-end with AES-256-GCM. Even our relay servers cannot read your clipboard content.

**Q: Does Hypo work without internet?**  
A: Yes, if both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, they can sync directly without internet.

**Q: How much battery does Hypo use on Android?**  
A: Typically less than 2% per day with optimized settings. The foreground service is designed to be battery-efficient. Battery drain is reduced by 60-80% when screen is off.

**Q: Why does the notification say "Click to sync"?**  
A: On Android 10+, clipboard access is only available when the app is in the foreground. The notification provides quick access to open the app and sync clipboard content. Tap the notification to open Hypo and sync your clipboard.

**Q: Can I sync between more than 2 devices?**  
A: Currently, Hypo supports pairing between 2 devices. Multi-device support is planned for a future release.

**Q: Can Hypo sync SMS messages?**  
A: Yes! On Android, Hypo can automatically copy incoming SMS messages to the clipboard and sync them to macOS. Enable SMS permission in Settings to use this feature. Note: Android 10+ may have restrictions on SMS access.

**Q: What happens if I copy a password?**  
A: Passwords are encrypted like any other content. However, we recommend using a dedicated password manager for sensitive credentials.

### Privacy & Security

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Clipboard history is stored locally on each device in encrypted form. Cloud relay servers never store your content.

**Q: Can your company read my clipboard?**  
A: No. We use end-to-end encryption, so even we cannot decrypt your clipboard content.

**Q: How often are encryption keys rotated?**  
A: Encryption keys are automatically rotated every 30 days with a 7-day grace period for smooth transition.

**Q: What data do you collect?**  
A: By default, we collect no usage data. Optional telemetry can be enabled in settings for performance improvement.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which ports does Hypo use?**  
A: Hypo uses dynamic ports for LAN discovery (mDNS) and a randomly assigned port for device-to-device communication.

**Q: Can I use Hypo on cellular networks?**  
A: Yes, using cloud relay. However, LAN sync requires both devices on the same Wi-Fi network.

**Q: How large files can I sync?**  
A: 
- **Sync Limit**: 10MB per item (images and files)
- **Copy Limit**: 50MB per item (prevents excessive disk usage)
- Items larger than 10MB cannot be synced between devices
- Items larger than 50MB cannot be copied to clipboard (but can be synced if under 10MB)
- Temporary files are automatically cleaned up after 30 seconds or when clipboard changes

**Q: Does Hypo work with VPNs?**  
A: LAN sync may not work with VPN. Cloud relay sync should work normally with most VPN configurations.
