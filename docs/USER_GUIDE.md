2. Restart router/Wi-Fi connection
3. Check for network interference
4. Close other network-intensive apps
5. Clear clipboard history (Settings ‚Üí Clear History)

#### "Android App Killed by System"

**Symptoms**: Sync stops working after phone sleep  
**Solutions**:
1. Disable battery optimization for Hypo
2. Add Hypo to "Protected Apps" (manufacturer specific)
3. Ensure "Auto-start" is enabled
4. Check notification permission granted
5. Restart the sync service

## ‚ùì FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my clipboard data secure?**  
A: Yes. All data is encrypted end-to-end with AES-256-GCM. Even our relay servers cannot read your clipboard content.

**Q: Does Hypo work without internet?**  
A: Yes, if both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network, they can sync directly without internet.

**Q: How much battery does Hypo use on Android?**  
A: Typically less than 2% per day with optimized settings. The foreground service is designed to be battery-efficient.

**Q: Can I sync between more than 2 devices?**  
A: Currently, Hypo supports pairing between 2 devices. Multi-device support is planned for a future release.

**Q: What happens if I copy a password?**  
A: Passwords are encrypted like any other content. However, we recommend using a dedicated password manager for sensitive credentials.

### Privacy & Security

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Clipboard history is stored locally on each device in encrypted form. Cloud relay servers never store your content.

**Q: Can your company read my clipboard?**  
A: No. We use end-to-end encryption, so even we cannot decrypt your clipboard content.

**Q: How often are encryption keys rotated?**  
A: Encryption keys are automatically rotated every 30 days with a 7-day grace period for smooth transition.

**Q: What data do you collect?**  
A: By default, we collect no usage data. Optional telemetry can be enabled in settings for performance improvement.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Which ports does Hypo use?**  
A: Hypo uses dynamic ports for LAN discovery (mDNS) and a randomly assigned port for device-to-device communication.

**Q: Can I use Hypo on cellular networks?**  
A: Yes, using cloud relay. However, LAN sync requires both devices on the same Wi-Fi network.

**Q: How large files can I sync?**  
A: Currently limited to 1MB per item. Larger file support via cloud storage is planned for future versions.

**Q: Does Hypo work with VPNs?**  
A: LAN sync may not work with VPN. Cloud relay sync should work normally with most VPN configurations.
