## 🎯 Current Milestone: Foundation Setup

### Completed ✅
- [x] Project inception and PRD analysis
- [x] Created foundational architecture (docs/architecture.mermaid)
- [x] Wrote comprehensive technical specification (docs/technical.md)
- [x] Defined development tasks and sprints (tasks/tasks.md)
- [x] Created project status tracking (docs/status.md)

### In Progress 🚧
- [ ] Initialize project structure (mono-repo layout)
- [ ] Set up development environments for all platforms
- [ ] Create initial README with setup instructions

### Blocked 🚫

## 📊 Sprint Progress

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Architecture (Weeks 1-2)
**Progress**: 30%

| Phase | Status | Completion |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Phase 1.1: Project Setup | In Progress | 50% |
| Phase 1.2: Protocol Definition | Not Started | 0% |
| Phase 1.3: Security Foundation | Not Started | 0% |

**Next Steps**:
1. Create mono-repo directory structure
2. Initialize platform-specific projects (Xcode, Android Studio, Cargo)
3. Define and document JSON message protocol
4. Research and select cryptographic libraries

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack Decisions
| Component | Decision | Rationale | Date |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------|
| macOS Client | Swift 6 + SwiftUI | Native performance, modern concurrency | Oct 1, 2025 |
| Android Client | Kotlin 2.0 + Compose | Modern UI, coroutines for async | Oct 1, 2025 |
| Backend Relay | Rust + Actix-web | Performance, memory safety, WebSocket support | Oct 1, 2025 |
| Storage - macOS | Core Data | Native integration, CloudKit future-proof | Oct 1, 2025 |
| Storage - Android | Room | Official Jetpack library, Flow support | Oct 1, 2025 |
| State Storage - Backend | Redis | In-memory speed, ephemeral state | Oct 1, 2025 |
| Encryption | AES-256-GCM | Industry standard, authenticated encryption | Oct 1, 2025 |
| Key Exchange | ECDH | Forward secrecy, QR code compatibility | Oct 1, 2025 |
| Transport | WebSocket | Bi-directional, real-time, wide support | Oct 1, 2025 |

### Open Questions
- [ ] Should we use Protocol Buffers instead of JSON for performance?
  - **Context**: JSON is ~30% larger but more debuggable
  - **Decision Deadline**: End of Sprint 1
- [ ] Should we support iCloud/Google Drive integration in v1?
  - **Context**: Allows >1MB file sync but adds complexity
  - **Decision Deadline**: Sprint 4
- [ ] What's our target minimum Android API level?
  - **Context**: API 26+ for stable foreground service, but API 29+ for better clipboard API
  - **Decision Deadline**: End of Sprint 1

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### UX Patterns
- **macOS**: Menu bar app (no Dock icon) for minimal intrusion
- **Android**: Material 3 with dynamic color matching system theme
- **Notifications**: Rich previews with actionable buttons
- **History UI**: Search-first, reverse chronological

### Content Type Priority
1. **Text** (MVP, most common use case)
2. **Links** (MVP, high value for browser workflows)
3. **Images** (Sprint 4, requires compression)
4. **Files** (Sprint 4, limited to 1MB)

## 📈 Metrics Tracking

### Performance Targets
| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| LAN Sync Latency (P95) | < 500ms | N/A | Not Measured |
| Cloud Sync Latency (P95) | < 3s | N/A | Not Measured |
| Memory Usage - macOS | < 50MB | N/A | Not Measured |
| Memory Usage - Android | < 30MB | N/A | Not Measured |
| Battery Drain - Android | < 2% per day | N/A | Not Measured |
| Error Rate | < 0.1% | N/A | Not Measured |

### Test Coverage
| Platform | Target | Current |
|----------|--------|---------|
| macOS Client | 80% | 0% |
| Android Client | 80% | 0% |
| Backend Relay | 90% | 0% |

## 🔄 Recent Changes

### October 1, 2025
- **Initialization**: Created project from PRD
- **Documentation**: Established foundational architecture docs
- **Planning**: Defined 8-sprint roadmap (16 weeks to beta)

---

## 🎯 Next Review

**Date**: October 8, 2025 (End of Sprint 1 Week 1)  
**Focus**: Review project structure, protocol definition, and crypto library selection

## 📝 Notes

### Development Environment Status
- **macOS Development**: Requires macOS 26+ with Xcode 15+
- **Android Development**: Any platform with Android Studio Hedgehog+
- **Backend Development**: Any platform with Rust 1.75+

### Team Composition
- **Current**: Solo development (autonomous principal engineer)
- **Future**: May need beta testers in Sprint 8

### Risk Register
1. **Android Background Restrictions**: HyperOS may impose stricter limits than stock Android
   - *Mitigation*: Foreground service + battery optimization exemption request
2. **Apple Sandbox**: Future Mac App Store distribution may conflict with clipboard monitoring
   - *Mitigation*: Research entitlements, may need direct distribution only
3. **Encryption Performance**: AES-GCM on every clipboard update may impact latency
   - *Mitigation*: Performance testing in Sprint 7, optimize if needed
